# Zotify

playlist_maker creates a playlist of your favorite songs on Spotify!!!

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) before running the code

```bash
pip install spotipy
```

## Usage
In the terminal, do npm start to start the server.
Run main.py to make a Spotify playlist containing all your most-played songs.

Input your Spotify [user ID](https://i.imgur.com/pj3Ushz.png). 

For example, my Spotify URI is: "spotify:user:yridp68vzs69q3cn7rdijnyo4"
My user ID would be "yridp68vzs69q3cn7rdijnyo4"


Afterwards, input the link to the page you got redirected to in the terminal you ran app.py twice. (This is because it makes two token requests for permissions).


## TODO

In the future, we hope to implement Genius' api so you can see the lyrics of your favorite songs.
